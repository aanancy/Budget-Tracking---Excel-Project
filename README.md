## Benefits and Limitations of Using Spreadsheets for Data Analysis
### Benefits
- **User-Friendly Interface** – Intuitive table format for easy data organization and visualization.
- **Data Comparison** – Functions like VLOOKUP and XLOOKUP allow quick comparisons between fields.
- **SQL Table Emulation** – Custom formulas enable relational data management on a small scale.
- **Versatile Tools** – Pivot tables, charts, and formulas support basic data summarization and visualization.
- **Ideal for Small Datasets** – Handles up to 20,000 records effectively for straightforward analysis.
- **Accessibility** – Easy to learn and widely available for users at all levels.

### Limitations
- **Lack of Reproducibility** – Filtering, sorting, and formula applications lack a built-in log.
- **Performance Issues** – Struggles with datasets exceeding 100,000 rows, leading to crashes or slowdowns.
- **Limited Scalability** – Not suitable for complex statistical modeling or machine learning.
- **Error-Prone** – Manual data entry increases the risk of inaccuracies.
- **Collaboration Challenges** – Multi-user editing can be cumbersome without cloud-based tools.
- **Automation Constraints** – Lacks the automation and repeatability of programming languages like Python or R.
- **Data Integration** – Merging data from multiple sources is possible but can be tedious without advanced tools like Power Query.
